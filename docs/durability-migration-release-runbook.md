## 1. Architecture & Background

### Context & Separation of Concerns
1. **Separation from Application Startup:** The Go Backend's GORM `AutoMigrate()` and the historical ledger table `public.schema_migrations` (currently at `20260918_01_admin_subscription_mutation`) intentionally **do not** apply the backend durability migration.
2. **Startup Gate Requirement:** The new Backend binary (PR #47 / `master`) calls `ValidateBackendDurabilitySchema(ctx, db)` at application initialization. If the durability marker or any required column/index is absent or malformed, the binary **fails closed** and terminates immediately to prevent inconsistent or uncommitted task states.
3. **Dual Compatibility:** The schema changes in `20261029_backend_durability.up.sql` are strictly additive and nullable:
   - Existing tables (`users`, `orders`, `transactions`, `email_verifications`, `password_resets`, `api_usage_records`) are completely untouched.
   - `public.studio_jobs` gains an optional nullable `pending_object_keys jsonb` column.
   - Three new standalone tables are created: `task_completions`, `worker_result_ownerships`, and `studio_storage_object_retirements`.
   - The restored production Backend binary (`40dfe66886e7c7c5bc3f522e4ca5fcd55e669a02`) runs completely unhindered against the upgraded database. Queries on `studio_jobs` and existing tables continue without error because all new columns are nullable and historical queries do not select the new durability tables.
4. **Deployment Order Requirement:** Worker PR #13 must be deployed **before** Backend PR #47. Worker PR #13 defaults `dedup_scope="global"` for legacy callers (maintaining full backward-compatibility with the currently running production Backend), while Backend PR #47 actively transmits `dedup_scope=<hmac>` which an older Worker would ignore or fail.

## 2. Pre-Requisites & Guardrails

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Production Restrictions & Safeguards:**
> - Never execute migration commands with unbounded statement timeouts. `up.sql` explicitly sets `lock_timeout = '5s'` and `statement_timeout = '30s'`.
> - The migration acquires a session-level transactional advisory lock: `pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext('pdfnest:backend-durability-v1'))` to prevent concurrent migration attempts.
> - **Fail-Closed Unversioned Table Guard:** If any of `task_completions`, `worker_result_ownerships`, `studio_storage_object_retirements`, or `studio_jobs.pending_object_keys` already exist without `backend_durability_schema`, the migration raises an exception and rolls back immediately.

## 3. Phase 1: Read-Only Preflight Verification

Before initiating any database modification, run the following read-only SQL queries to verify pre-conditions:

### Step 1.1: Verify Connection & User Privileges
```sql
-- Verify current connected database, user, and server version
SELECT current_database(), current_user, version();

-- Confirm current user has CREATE and USAGE on schema public
SELECT has_schema_privilege(current_user, 'public', 'CREATE') AS can_create,
       has_schema_privilege(current_user, 'public', 'USAGE') AS can_usage;
```
*Expected: `can_create = true`, `can_usage = true`.*

### Step 1.2: Check for Lock Contention or Long-Running Transactions
```sql
-- Check for active queries or blocking locks on studio_jobs
SELECT pid, state, age(clock_timestamp(), query_start) AS duration, query 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE query NOT LIKE '%pg_stat_activity%' 
  AND state != 'idle'
ORDER BY query_start ASC;
```
*Expected: No blocking locks or transactions older than 10 seconds.*

### Step 1.3: Confirm Absence of Unversioned Conflicting Objects
```sql
-- Verify whether the durability tables or columns currently exist
SELECT 
    to_regclass('public.backend_durability_schema') AS marker_table,
    to_regclass('public.task_completions') AS task_completions,
    to_regclass('public.worker_result_ownerships') AS worker_result_ownerships,
    to_regclass('public.studio_storage_object_retirements') AS studio_storage_object_retirements,
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
        WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
          AND table_name = 'studio_jobs' 
          AND column_name = 'pending_object_keys'
    ) AS pending_object_keys_col;
```
*Expected before initial migration: All columns return NULL / false (or if already applied, marker_table is non-null).*

### Step 1.4: Confirm Historical Migration Ledger Integrity
```sql
-- Verify the last applied historical migration
SELECT version, applied_at FROM public.schema_migrations ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 3;
```
*Expected: Latest version is `20260918_01_admin_subscription_mutation` with a valid timestamp.*

## 4. Phase 2: Snapshot, Backup & Disposable Restore Rehearsal Prerequisite

Take an explicit, verifiable snapshot of the database and qualify actual recoverability via disposable rehearsal before applying DDL:

```bash
# 1. Point DATABASE_URL environment variable to Railway production PostgreSQL instance
BACKUP_FILE="pdfnest_backup_pre_durability_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).dump"
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" \
  --format=custom \
  --schema=public \
  --file="$BACKUP_FILE"

# 2. Verify dump file exists and has non-zero size
ls -lh "$BACKUP_FILE"

# 3. Verify TOC listing
pg_restore --list "$BACKUP_FILE" > /dev/null
echo "Backup archive TOC listing verified."

# 4. Perform live rehearsal restore into disposable target database
# Note: pg_restore --list verifies archive framing, but NOT database recoverability.
# A full rehearsal restore into a disposable PostgreSQL database is required.
REHEARSAL_DB="pdfnest_rehearsal_$(date +%s)"
createdb "$REHEARSAL_DB"
pg_restore -d "$REHEARSAL_DB" --schema=public "$BACKUP_FILE"

# 5. Verify row counts and integrity in restored database
psql -d "$REHEARSAL_DB" -c "
  SELECT 'users' AS tbl, count(*) FROM public.users
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'studio_jobs', count(*) FROM public.studio_jobs
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'schema_migrations', count(*) FROM public.schema_migrations;
"
dropdb "$REHEARSAL_DB"
echo "Disposable rehearsal restore completed successfully with verified integrity."
```

---

## 5. Phase 3: Transactional Migration Execution

Execute the verified idempotent script `config/migrations/20261029_backend_durability.up.sql` inside a single transaction:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f config/migrations/20261029_backend_durability.up.sql
```

*Raw SQL equivalent (for execution in an admin SQL console):*
```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '5s';
SET LOCAL statement_timeout = '30s';
SELECT pg_catalog.pg_advisory_xact_lock(pg_catalog.hashtext('pdfnest:backend-durability-v1'));

DO $$ DECLARE approved boolean; BEGIN
 IF to_regclass('public.backend_durability_schema') IS NULL THEN
  IF to_regclass('public.task_completions') IS NOT NULL
   OR to_regclass('public.worker_result_ownerships') IS NOT NULL
   OR to_regclass('public.studio_storage_object_retirements') IS NOT NULL
   OR EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='studio_jobs' AND column_name='pending_object_keys')
  THEN RAISE EXCEPTION 'unversioned durability schema exists; inspect before adoption'; END IF;
 ELSE
  EXECUTE 'SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM public.backend_durability_schema WHERE version=''20261029_backend_durability_v1'')' INTO approved;
  IF NOT approved THEN RAISE EXCEPTION 'unrecognized durability schema marker'; END IF;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_worker_result_ownerships_next_attempt_at ON public.worker_result_ownerships(next_attempt_at);

ALTER TABLE public.studio_jobs ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS pending_object_keys jsonb;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.studio_storage_object_retirements (
 object_key varchar(512) PRIMARY KEY,
 created_at timestamptz
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.backend_durability_schema (version varchar(64) PRIMARY KEY, applied_at timestamptz NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO public.backend_durability_schema(version,applied_at) VALUES ('20261029_backend_durability_v1',now()) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

COMMIT;
```

## 6. Phase 4: Read-Only Post-Condition Verification

Verify that all schema requirements mandated by `ValidateBackendDurabilitySchema` are satisfied:

### Step 4.1: Confirm Schema Marker
```sql
SELECT version, applied_at FROM public.backend_durability_schema;
```
*Expected: 1 row with `version = '20261029_backend_durability_v1'`.*

### Step 4.2: Confirm Tables and Column Definitions
```sql
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND (
    (table_name = 'studio_jobs' AND column_name = 'pending_object_keys') OR
    (table_name = 'task_completions' AND column_name IN ('id', 'owner_identity', 'state', 'result_key')) OR
    (table_name = 'worker_result_ownerships' AND column_name IN ('id', 'request_id', 'state')) OR
    (table_name = 'studio_storage_object_retirements' AND column_name = 'object_key')
  )
ORDER BY table_name, column_name;
```
*Expected: All 4 tables return the specified columns with matching types (`jsonb` for `pending_object_keys`, `varchar`/`text` for identifiers).*

### Step 4.3: Confirm Exact Constraints and Indexes (Uniqueness & Validity)
```sql
-- Verify specific primary keys, index names, uniqueness, and validity
SELECT 
    t.relname AS tablename,
    i.relname AS indexname,
    idx.indisunique AS is_unique,
    idx.indisvalid AS is_valid
FROM pg_index idx
JOIN pg_class t ON t.oid = idx.indrelid
JOIN pg_class i ON i.oid = idx.indexrelid
JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = t.relnamespace
WHERE n.nspname = 'public' 
  AND t.relname IN ('task_completions', 'worker_result_ownerships', 'studio_storage_object_retirements', 'backend_durability_schema')
ORDER BY t.relname, i.relname;
```
*Expected: The following 12 exact index objects must be returned, all with `is_valid = true`:*
- `backend_durability_schema`:
  - `backend_durability_schema_pkey` (UNIQUE, VALID)
- `studio_storage_object_retirements`:
  - `studio_storage_object_retirements_pkey` (UNIQUE, VALID)
- `task_completions`:
  - `task_completions_pkey` (UNIQUE, VALID)
  - `idx_task_completions_expires_at` (NON-UNIQUE, VALID)
  - `idx_task_completions_reservation_id` (NON-UNIQUE, VALID)
  - `idx_task_completions_state` (NON-UNIQUE, VALID)
- `worker_result_ownerships`:
  - `worker_result_ownerships_pkey` (UNIQUE, VALID)
  - `idx_worker_result_ownerships_expires_at` (NON-UNIQUE, VALID)
  - `idx_worker_result_ownerships_next_attempt_at` (NON-UNIQUE, VALID)
  - `idx_worker_result_ownerships_request_id` (UNIQUE, VALID)
  - `idx_worker_result_ownerships_state` (NON-UNIQUE, VALID)
  - `idx_worker_result_ownerships_worker_job_id` (NON-UNIQUE, VALID)

> [!NOTE]
> Automated verification of all 12 indexes, their uniqueness, and their validity is enforced in preflight test `TestPreflight_ExplicitIndexAndConstraintValidation`.

> [!NOTE]
> Idempotency of the upgrade script has been fully preflight-verified in disposable fixtures (`TestPreflight_UpgradeIdempotency`). Do not re-run DDL in production unnecessarily.

## 7. Phase 5: Ordered Service Deployment & Health Verification

Once the database migration is confirmed:

1. **Deploy Worker First:** Deploy the paired Worker candidate (PR #13) on Railway services `pdfnest-worker` and `alert-benevolence`.
   - Worker PR #13 defaults `dedup_scope="global"` for legacy callers, ensuring uninterrupted operation with existing Backend traffic.
2. **Deploy Backend Second:** Deploy the combined Backend candidate (PR #47).
3. **Verify Startup Gate:** Check application container logs to ensure `ValidateBackendDurabilitySchema` passes without warnings or panics.
4. **Verify Health Endpoints:**
   ```bash
   curl -s -i https://<backend-host>/healthz
   # Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   curl -s -i https://<backend-host>/api/health
   # Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK with database: "healthy"
   ```

---

## 8. Rollback Procedures & Safeguards

### Procedure A: Binary Rollback with Retained Records (Default Recommended Response)
If the new Backend binary exhibits runtime issues, **do not revert the database schema**. Revert the Railway deployment to the known-good Backend image (`40dfe66886e7c7c5bc3f522e4ca5fcd55e669a02`).
- **SQL-Level Compatibility:** As validated in `TestPreflight_OldBinaryCompatibilityWithUpgradedSchema`, existing queries and transactions continue to function without error because all schema modifications are additive and nullable.
- **Actual Runtime Binary Compatibility:** As demonstrated in `TestPreflight_HistoricalBinaryRuntimeCompatibility`, the historical Backend binary at `40dfe66886e7c7c5bc3f522e4ca5fcd55e669a02` was compiled from source and executed live against the upgraded database schema on disposable PostgreSQL. The binary successfully booted, connected to the migrated database, and responded `HTTP 200 OK` on `/api/health` and `/api/ready` (noting that the root `/healthz` route was introduced in subsequent backend revisions).
- This preserves all task completion tokens and worker ownership records written while the new binary was running, avoiding data loss or broken client download URLs.

### Procedure B: Schema Rollback (`down.sql`) Safeguards
If schema rollback is strictly required, execute `config/migrations/20261029_backend_durability.down.sql`.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Data Loss Protection Trigger:**
> `down.sql` contains an active guard:
> ```sql
> IF EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM public.task_completions) 
>   OR EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM public.worker_result_ownerships)
>   OR EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM public.studio_storage_object_retirements)
>   OR EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM public.studio_jobs WHERE pending_object_keys IS NOT NULL AND pending_object_keys <> '[]'::jsonb)
> THEN RAISE EXCEPTION 'durability rollback refused: retained ownership exists'; END IF;
> ```
> If any task records or pending object keys were written during runtime, the rollback script **actively refuses** to drop tables. Any retained data must be audited or manually archived before dropping durability structures.
